cpp.regex
---
The file contains regular expression patterns and substitutions for C++ Syntax, which will be used in sed utility for replacement.


coloring.awk
---
This file will read patterns and substitutions from regex file, and generate sed file for replacement.

***TO BE IMPLEMENTED:***   
It will also concatenate special multiple lines with &lt;br /&gt; into one line.   
The  multiple lines are the lines that end with backslash( \\ ), or the lines inside of C style comment blok ( /\* \*/ ).


_sedtmp
---
sed actions that generate by coloring.awk. 
This file will be removed in future


htmlencode.sed
---
This sed action should be done before any other substitutions, it merely encodes following three characters:
    
    &	=>	&amp;   
    >	=>	&gt;   
    <	=>	&lt;   
    
    
coloring.sh
---
This is the manager of each coloring steps.   
In the script, it call sed with htmlencode to encode cpp package file first.   
Then call awk to generate other sed file.   
Call sed with new file again, then merge with head and tails.  


codestyle.css
---

Those files will be removed in future
